## Application of Federated Learning Techniques in Document Recognition

# Abstract
Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a potential paradigm for collaborative model training
over several decentralized devices while maintaining data privacy. On the MNIST dataset, this
study looks at the performance of FL models that use Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and
K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) algorithms for document recognition. We compare the FedAvg
optimization algorithm's effectiveness in training CNN models to the efficiency of the Federated
K-NN technique. Experimental results show that the CNN model has competitive accuracy,
averaging approximately 89%, and is resilient to variability in local data distributions. In
comparison, the K-NN method achieves superior accuracy, averaging approximately 96%, with
minimum training overhead and resource-efficient inference. Our comparative analysis highlights
the distinct strengths and limitations of each approach, underscoring the importance of FL
techniques in preserving data privacy and enabling collaborative model training across distributed
clients. These findings pave the way for future research directions aimed at refining FL algorithms,
addressing domain-specific challenges, and conducting extensive benchmarking studies across
diverse datasets and model architectures.
